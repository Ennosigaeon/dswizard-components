[_dswizard_](https://github.com/Ennosigaeon/dswizzard) is an efficient solver for machine learning (ML) pipeline
synthesis inspired by human behaviour. It automatically derives a pipeline structure, selects algorithms and performs
hyperparameter optimization. This repository contains all _basic_ algorithms that can be optimized by _dswizard_. For
